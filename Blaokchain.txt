have you thought about this...what is the guarantee that on elections our votes are registered, in actual our votes got counted up... we get guarantee from a central ageancy, election commission of india.
we have to blindly trust on election commission. ok lets think of a situation, if we can take the guarantee from ourselves that not need to trust on anyone for this, yes we can verify that our voted get 
counted for the for same party. yes this is possible by using blockchain, the technology on which bitcoin is based.


blockchain is a technique to store information in decentralized manner. decentralized means there is no central authority to contrl the data.
